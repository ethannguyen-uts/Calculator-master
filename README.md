# Descriptions

A university project that require develop a macOS command-line tool that will act as a simple calculator. The calculator will be run from the command line and will only work with integer numbers and the following arithmetic operators: `+` `-` `x` `/` `%`. The `%` operator is the modulus operator, not percentage.

# Requirement:

For example, if the program is compiled to `calc`, the following demonstrates how it will work

    ./calc 3 + 5 - 7
    1

In the command line, the arguments are a repeated sequence in the form

    number operator

and ending in a

    number

Hitting the enter key will cause the program to evaluate the arguments and print the result. In this case `1`.

The program must follow the usual rules of arithmetic which say:

1. The `x` `/` and `%` operators must all be evaluated before the `+` and `–` operators.
2. Operators must be evaluated from left to right.

For example, using Rule 1

> 2 + 4 x 3 – 6

becomes

> 2 + 12 – 6

which results in

> 8

If we did not use Rule 1 then `2 + 4 x 3 – 6` would become `6 x 3 – 6` and then `18 – 6` and finally `12`. This is an incorrect result.

If we do not use Rule 2 then the following illustrates how it can go wrong

> 4 x 5 % 2

Going from left to right we evaluate the `x` first, which reduces the expression to `20 % 2` which becomes `0`. If we evaluated the `%` first then the expression would reduce to `4 x 1` which becomes `4`. This is an incorrect result.

Remember, we are using integer mathematics when doing our calculations, so we get integer results when doing division. For example

    ./calc 20 / 3
    6

Also note that we can use the unary `+` and `–` operators. For example

    ./calc -5 / +2
    -2

    ./calc +2 - -2
    4
